     'abstract': 'Background & Aims
     Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is an immune-mediated cholestatic liver disease for which there is an unmet need to understand the cellular composition of the affected liver and how it underlies disease pathogenesis. We aimed to generate a comprehensive atlas of the PSC liver using multi-omic modalities and protein-based functional validation.
     Methods
     We employed single-cell and single-nucleus RNA sequencing (47,156 cells and 23,000 nuclei) and spatial transcriptomics (one sample by 10x Visium and five samples with Nanostring GeoMx DSP) to profile the cellular ecosystem in 10 PSC livers. Transcriptomic profiles were compared to 24 neurologically deceased donor livers (107,542 cells) and spatial transcriptomics controls, as well as 18,240 cells and 20,202 nuclei from three PBC livers. Flow cytometry was performed to validate PSC-specific differences in immune cell phenotype and function.
     Results
     PSC explants with parenchymal cirrhosis and prominent periductal fibrosis contained a population of cholangiocyte-like hepatocytes that were surrounded by diverse immune cell populations. PSC-associated biliary, mesenchymal, and endothelial populations expressed chemokine and cytokine transcripts involved in immune cell recruitment. Additionally, expanded CD4+ T cells and recruited myeloid populations in the PSC liver expressed the corresponding receptors to these chemokines and cytokines, suggesting potential recruitment. Tissue-resident macrophages, by contrast, were reduced in number and exhibited a dysfunctional and downregulated inflammatory response to lipopolysaccharide and interferon-Î³ stimulation.
     Conclusions
     We present a comprehensive atlas of the PSC liver and demonstrate an exhaustion-like phenotype of myeloid cells and markers of chronic cytokine expression in late-stage PSC lesions. This atlas expands our understanding of the cellular complexity of PSC and has potential to guide the development of novel treatments.
     Impact and Implications
     Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is a rare liver disease characterized by chronic inflammation and irreparable damage to the bile ducts, which eventually results in liver failure. Due to a limited understanding of the underlying pathogenesis of disease, treatment options are limited. To address this, we sequenced healthy and diseased livers to compare the activity, interactions, and localization of immune and non-immune cells. This revealed that hepatocytes lining PSC scar regions co-express cholangiocyte markers, whereas immune cells infiltrate the scar lesions. Of these cells, macrophages, which typically contribute to tissue repair, were enriched in immunoregulatory genes and demonstrated a lack of responsiveness to stimulation. These cells may be involved in maintaining hepatic inflammation and could be a target for novel therapies.
